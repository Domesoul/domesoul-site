    <h2>Feels Like Heaven With You</h2>
    <h3>Behind the Song</h3>
    <p>Some people don’t just walk into your life — they light it up.</p>
    <p><em>“Feels Like Heaven With You”</em> was written as a gentle celebration of that rare kind of love — the kind that doesn’t just excite you, but anchors you.</p>
    <p>It’s about peace that follows presence. About feeling like home in someone’s laugh, in their silence, in their flaws.</p>
    <p>The world can be loud, cruel, uncertain. But when I’m with you — everything softens. In that stillness, in that knowing… it feels like heaven.</p>

    <h3>Lyrics</h3>
    <pre>
Verse 1
I was drifting like a song without a key  
Empty streets and skies that wouldn’t speak  
Then you walked in with a quiet light  
And suddenly the dark felt right  

Verse 2
I was breaking piece by piece inside  
Smiling just to keep the pain in line  
But you touched me without a word  
And gave me peace I’d never heard  

Chorus
Feels like heaven with you  
Like every storm finally passed through  
No need to run, no need to hide  
I found a home right by your side  
Ooooh…  
Feels like heaven…  
With you  

Verse 3
You don’t ask me to be more than me  
You love the scars, not just the dreams  
And even when I lose my way  
You hold the silence I can’t say  

Verse 4
You don’t fix me, you just stay  
Through every tear I push away  
Like sunlight through a cloudy wall  
You always catch me when I fall  

Chorus
Feels like heaven with you  
Like all my questions met the truth  
No more fear, no more disguise  
Just real love in real time  
Ooooh…  
Feels like heaven…  
With you  

Bridge
Maybe this is what grace feels like   
Maybe this is what home sounds like   
No halos, no wings in view   
But heaven showed up… when I met you  

Final Chorus
Feels like heaven with you  
When I’m lost, your voice pulls through  
You’re my prayer, my melody  
My now, my soul, eternity  
Ooooh…  
Feels like heaven…  
With you  

Outro
With you…  
It feels like heaven…
