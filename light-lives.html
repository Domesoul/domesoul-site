    <h2>Behind the Song</h2>
    <p>This song was born from a quiet question: <em>What if hope had a home?</em></p>
    <p><strong>“Where the Light Lives”</strong> was written during a season of shadows — not just in the world, but within. I had seen people laugh with broken hearts, give with empty hands, and walk through fire still singing. And I realized: the light doesn’t always live in perfect places.</p>
    <p>It lives in the eyes of a child who still dreams.<br/>
    In the hands of a stranger who reaches out.<br/>
    In the quiet strength of those who have every reason to quit — and don’t.</p>
    <p>This song is my offering to them.<br/>
    A reminder that no matter the dust, despair, or distance —<br/>
    <strong>the light still lives. And maybe, just maybe, it lives in us.</strong></p>

      <h3>Lyrics</h3>
Verse 1
I’ve wandered deserts, crossed oceans wide,  
But peace only came when I saw your eyes.  
You speak in silence, yet I hear it all,  
The gentle thunder that made me fall.

Verse 2 
I’ve danced with sorrow, slept next to fear,  
But you were the song I needed to hear.  
Your hands don’t just hold, they understand,  
You carry my heart like sacred land.

Chorus
Take me where the light lives…  
Where the shadows run, and the soul forgives.  
If this world fades and the stars go dim,  
I’ll still find home when I find you again.  
Take me where the light lives…

Verse 3
You turn the quiet into sacred sound,  
In your stillness, I’m finally found.  
No need for riches, no kingdom throne,  
If I have your love, I am not alone.

Verse 4 
You see the colors I try to hide,  
And paint me whole from the inside.  
Not just a lover, you’re part of me,  
The place I go just to be free.

Chorus
Take me where the light lives…  
Where the shadows run, and the soul forgives.  
If this world fades and the stars go dim,  
I’ll still find home when I find you again.  
Take me where the light lives…

Bridge  
Dominic: Even when I’m lost in the noise and rain...  
Rosetta: I will find you through every ache and flame.  
Both: No force of time, no mountain high —  
Could tear this light from you and I.

Final Chorus 
Take me where the light lives…  
Where your voice calms and your presence gives.  
No matter where tomorrow bends,  
I’ll walk with you until the end…  
Take me where the light… lives.
