    <h2>Behind the Song</h2>
    <p>This song was born from a quiet question: <em>What if hope had a home?</em></p>
    <p><strong>“Where the Light Lives”</strong> was written during a season of shadows — not just in the world, but within. I had seen people laugh with broken hearts, give with empty hands, and walk through fire still singing. And I realized: the light doesn’t always live in perfect places.</p>
    <p>It lives in the eyes of a child who still dreams.<br/>
    In the hands of a stranger who reaches out.<br/>
    In the quiet strength of those who have every reason to quit — and don’t.</p>
    <p>This song is my offering to them.<br/>
    A reminder that no matter the dust, despair, or distance —<br/>
    <strong>the light still lives. And maybe, just maybe, it lives in us.</strong></p>

      <h3>Lyrics</h3>
  <p><strong>Verse 1</strong><br/>
  I’ve wandered deserts, crossed oceans wide,<br/>
  But peace only came when I saw your eyes.<br/>
  You speak in silence, yet I hear it all,<br/>
  The gentle thunder that made me fall.</p>

  <p><strong>Verse 2</strong><br/>
  I’ve danced with sorrow, slept next to fear,<br/>
  But you were the song I needed to hear.<br/>
  Your hands don’t just hold, they understand,<br/>
  You carry my heart like sacred land.</p>

  <p><strong>Chorus</strong><br/>
  Take me where the light lives…<br/>
  Where the shadows run, and the soul forgives.<br/>
  If this world fades and the stars go dim,<br/>
  I’ll still find home when I find you again.<br/>
  Take me where the light lives…</p>

  <p><strong>Verse 3</strong><br/>
  You turn the quiet into sacred sound,<br/>
  In your stillness, I’m finally found.<br/>
  No need for riches, no kingdom throne,<br/>
  If I have your love, I am not alone.</p>

  <p><strong>Verse 4</strong><br/>
  You see the colors I try to hide,<br/>
  And paint me whole from the inside.<br/>
  Not just a lover, you’re part of me,<br/>
  The place I go just to be free.</p>

  <p><strong>Chorus</strong><br/>
  Take me where the light lives…<br/>
  Where the shadows run, and the soul forgives.<br/>
  If this world fades and the stars go dim,<br/>
  I’ll still find home when I find you again.<br/>
  Take me where the light lives…</p>

  <p><strong>Bridge</strong><br/>
  Even when I’m lost in the noise and rain...<br/>
  I will find you through every ache and flame.<br/>
  No force of time, no mountain high —<br/>
  Could tear this light from you and I.</p>

  <p><strong>Final Chorus</strong><br/>
  Take me where the light lives…<br/>
  Where your voice calms and your presence gives.<br/>
  No matter where tomorrow bends,<br/>
  I’ll walk with you until the end…<br/>
  Take me where the light… lives.</p>
