  <h2>🌍 Our Soul Mission</h2>
  <p class="intro">
    <em>Music can move crowds — but it can also move compassion.</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    At Domé Soul, we believe that every song should serve more than just the ears — it should serve the heart. That’s why we created <strong>The Soul Mission</strong>: a humanitarian outreach rooted in music, hope, and giving.
  </p>
  <p>
    From conflict zones to forgotten villages, we’ve seen what music can do. It inspires. It heals. It brings people together.
  </p>
  <p>
    Through this mission, <strong>a portion of every project, stream, and performance goes back</strong> — to real people in need. We invite you, the listeners, to be part of that.
  </p>

  <h3>❤️ Nominate Someone in Need</h3>
  <p>
    Know someone going through a hard time?<br>
    You can now <strong>nominate individuals or families</strong> for a little act of love — a food pack, a solar light, a song, or even just a story shared with the world.
